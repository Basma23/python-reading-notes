# [Getting started with Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)

## Why Django?

With Django, you can take Web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. Django takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

- Ridiculously fast.
  - Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
- Fully loaded.
  - Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common Web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box.
- Reassuringly secure.
  - Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.
- Exceedingly scalable.
  - Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands.
- Incredibly versatile.
  - Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.

**Object-relational mapper**

Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.
```
    """A model of a rock band."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    can_rock = models.BooleanField(default=True)


class Member(models.Model):
    """A model of a rock band member."""
    name = models.CharField("Member's name", max_length=200)
    instrument = models.CharField(choices=(
            ('g', "Guitar"),
            ('b', "Bass"),
            ('d', "Drums"),
        ),
        max_length=1
    )
    band = models.ForeignKey("Band")
```

**URLs and views**

A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality Web application. Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.

To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.
```
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('bands/', views.band_listing, name='band-list'),
    path('bands/<int:band_id>/', views.band_detail, name='band-detail'),
    path('bands/search/', views.band_search, name='band-search'),
]
```
```
from django.shortcuts import render

def band_listing(request):
    """A view of all bands."""
    bands = models.Band.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'bands/band_listing.html', {'bands': bands})
```

**Templates**

Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Band Listing</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>All Bands</h1>
    <ul>
    {% for band in bands %}
      <li>
        <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
        {% if band.can_rock %}<p>This band can rock!</p>{% endif %}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```
**Forms**

Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

```
from django import forms

class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField()
    sender = forms.EmailField()
    cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
```

**Authentication**

Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that let users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

```
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.shortcuts import render

@login_required
def my_protected_view(request):
    """A view that can only be accessed by logged-in users"""
    return render(request, 'protected.html', {'current_user': request.user})
```

**Admin**

One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site. It’s easy to set up and provides many hooks for customization.
```
from django.contrib import admin
from bands.models import Band, Member

class MemberAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    """Customize the look of the auto-generated admin for the Member model"""
    list_display = ('name', 'instrument')
    list_filter = ('band',)

admin.site.register(Band)  # Use the default options
admin.site.register(Member, MemberAdmin)  # Use the customized options
```

**Internationalization**

Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers and time zones. It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize Web applications for particular users according to their preferences.
```
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.utils.translation import gettext

def homepage(request):
    """
    Shows the homepage with a welcome message that is translated in the
    user's language.
    """
    message = gettext('Welcome to our site!')
    return render(request, 'homepage.html', {'message': message})
```

```
{% load i18n %}
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{% trans 'Homepage - Hall of Fame' %}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {# Translated in the view: #}
    <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans count member_count=bands.count %}
      Here is the only band in the hall of fame:
      {% plural %}
      Here are all the {{ member_count }} bands in the hall of fame:
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <ul>
    {% for band in bands %}
      <li>
        <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
        {% if band.can_rock %}<p>{% trans 'This band can rock!' %}</p>{% endif %}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Security**

Django provides multiple protections against:

- Clickjacking
- Cross-site scripting
- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- SQL injection
- Remote code execution


# [How Django Works Behind the Scenes](https://wsvincent.com/how-django-works-behind-the-scenes/)

Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation. 

ِAlmost all popular open source packages have some degree of funding involved, typically in one of three forms:

1) Corporate Sponsor - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code. This is how React (Facebook) and Angular (Google) emerged. Typically engineers at the company are paid, in part, to work on open source though community involvement from developers outside of the core company occurs as well. While this structure has the stability of a wealthy benefactor, there can be confusion around the licensing aspects at times.

2) Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control. This is the case for VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel, among others. Typically the lead developer either raises contributions directly like Evan You of VueJS, offer add-on services like Spark for Laravel, or the founders provide highly-paid consulting services.

3) Non-profit - This was Django’s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, support, and advance Django.
