# [A Beginner's Guide to Docker](https://wsvincent.com/beginners-guide-to-docker/)

With Docker we now longer have to mess around with virtual environments. We can faithfully reproduce a production environment locally. And Docker can be shared among team members so everyone is working on the same setup

## Linux Containers

**Docker** is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.

Where virtualization has its roots at the beginning of computer science when large, expensive mainframe computers were the norm. How could multiple programmers use the same single machine? By virtualization and specifically virtual machines which are complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up.

If you rent space on a cloud provider like AWS they are typically not providing you with a dedicated piece of hardware. Instead you are probably sharing a physical server with hundreds or even thousands of other clients.

What’s the downside to a virtual machine? Size and speed. A typical guest operating system can easily take up 700MB of size. So if one physical server supports three virtual machines, that’s at least 2.1GB of disk space taken up along with separate needs for CPU and memory resources.

Most computers rely on the same Linux operating system, so what if we virtualized from that level up instead? Wouldn’t that provide a lightweight, faster way to duplicate much of the same functionality?

The answer is yes. And in recent years Linux containers, also known as “containerization,” has become increasingly popular. For most applications, a virtual machine provides far more resources than are needed and a container is more than sufficient.

This, fundamentally, is what Docker is. A way to implement Linux containers!
