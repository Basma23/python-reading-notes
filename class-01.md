# Pain and Suffering

The pain that you’ll experience during this course is no exception; most times it won’t feel good. You won’t feel good.

You’ll be pushed mentally, having to think your way through problems that you had only even heard about a few hours beforehand.
You’ll have to forge your own path toward a solution.
You’ll have to research for hours on end, fleshing out the skeleton that we discuss in class, piling information on top of application so that you can reach your goals.
You’ll be pushed emotionally, constantly confronted with your own lack of understanding of a topic.
You’ll Constantly be having to figure out how to collaborate with new people and deal with their (and your own) emotional quirks.
You’ll Constantly be thrust far outside of your comfort zone with the expectation that you’ll survive for the next push forward.
You’ll Constantly be dealing with uncertainty of what awaits you at the end of the 10 weeks, and whether or not you’ll make it.
You’ll be pushed physically, and while sitting in a chair and staring at your screen isn’t the most strenuous exercise in the world, the consecutive hours of it will take its toll.
You’ll lose sleep, you’ll forget to work out, and you’ll feel exhausted all while being filled with information day after day.
