# [Graphs](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of ```vertices``` (or ```nodes```) potentially connected by line segments named ```edges```.

## Directed vs Undirected Graphs

- Undirected Graphs
  - An ```Undirected Graph``` is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

- Directed Graphs (Digraph)
  - A ```Directed Graph``` also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

  - Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.

The three different types are completed, connected, and disconnected.

- Complete Graphs
  - A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

- Connected Graphs
  - A connected graph is graph that has all of ```vertices```/```nodes``` have at least one edge.

- Disconnected Graphs
  - A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

In addition to undirected and directed graphs, we also have acyclic and cyclic graphs.

- Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

- Cyclic Graphs
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

## Graph Representation

- Adjacency Matrix
  - An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

  - Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isn’t a connection.

- Adjacency List
  - An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

  - Adjacency lists make it easy to view if one vertices connects to another.

## Weighted Graphs

A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.

## Traversals

The traversals itself are like those of trees. Below is a breakdown of how you would traverse a graph.

- Breadth First
  - In a breadth first traversal, you are starting at a specific vertex/node. This node must be specified when calling the ```BreadthFirst()``` method. The breadth-first traversal of a graph is like that of a tree, with the exception that graphs can have cycles. When a graph has cycles and we are trying to traverse, this leaves the possibility to be in an infinite loop….this is bad. To prevent such behavior, we need to have some sort of flag that specifies if we have already visited that vertices. Upon each visit, we just set the “visited” flag from ```false``` to ```true```.

- Depth First
  - In a depth first traversal, we approach it a bit different than the way we do when working with a depth first traversal of a tree. Similar to how the breadth-first uses a queue, we are going to use a Stack for our depth-first traversal.

## Real World Uses of Graphs

Graphs are extremely popular when it comes to it’s uses. Here are just a few examples of graphs in use:

1. GPS and Mapping
2. Driving Directions
3. Social Networks
4. Airline Traffic
5. Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
