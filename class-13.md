# How to run Linear regression in Python 

There are several ways in which we can implement a linear regression in Python, we can do that by using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn.

**Scikit-learn** is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn.linear_model module which contains “methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables”.

- Explored the boston data set and then renamed its column names.

- Explored the boston data set using .DESCR, the goal was to predict the housing prices using the given features.

-  Using Scikit learn to fit linear regression to the entire data set and calculated the mean squared error.

- Made a train-test split and calculated the mean squared error for my training data and test data.

- Plotted the residuals for my training and test datasets.
